<h3>Solution to predict the Concentration of PM2.5 Pollution - PySpark</h3>
<p>Abstrat</p>
<p>In the industrialization era, air pollution levels and associated problems rose rapidly. Evidence shows that air pollution is one of the leading avoidable causes of disease and death globally. Even relatively low levels of air pollution pose health risks. One of the most important sources of air pollution is PM2.5. For the sustainable development of the human living environment, the international community needs to explore the core factors affecting air quality to reduce air pollution. This project used data mining methods and PySpark programming language to study air quality in Beijing. The three algorithms used in this project are linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, and the leading software is Jupyter Notebook. The results of the three models are generally consistent. Compounds in the air have a significant effect on the concentration of PM2.5; the influence of the external environment also impacts the concentration of PM2.5.The results of the analysis can be used as a reference to improve air quality. To reduce the emission of related compounds in the air could become the ultimate goal of reducing the concentration of PM2.5.
